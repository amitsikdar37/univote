            <h2>Feature 1: Zero-Knowledge Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Cast your vote with absolute anonymity. Our platform uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to mathematically separate your identity from your vote. The system verifies that you are an eligible voter without ever knowing who you are, ensuring your choice is a true secret. Upon completion of ongoing work on zk-proofs.

            <h2>Feature 2: On-Chain Verifiability</h2>
            <p>
                Trust through transparency. Every single valid vote is recorded as a transaction on the Base blockchain, creating a permanent and tamper-proof public record. Anyone can audit the final tally, providing cryptographic certainty that the results are fair and accurate.

                <h3>Feature 1: Customizable Eligibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Ensure only the right people participate. Our "Attested Claim-Nonce" model allows you to set specific rules for your election. Restrict voting to members with a verified institutional email (like @iitp.ac.in), holders of a specific token, or users with a connected X account.

                <h3>Feature 2: Built-in Sybil Resistance</h3>
                <p>
                    Prevent fraud and ensure fair representation. By requiring voters to attest their eligibility through unique credentials (like a social account or a specific ID), UNI-VOTE makes it incredibly difficult for a single person to create multiple fake accounts and unfairly influence the outcome.
